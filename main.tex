\section{Team Contract}
% Defining responsibilities and communication protocols
This project is undertaken by a solo developer, eliminating the need for a formal team contract. However, to maintain structure and accountability, the following self-imposed guidelines are established:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Responsibilities}: The developer is responsible for all aspects of the project, including conception, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
  \item \textbf{Communication}: Weekly progress reports will be maintained in a personal log and submitted as required. Feedback from the instructor will be actively sought via email or course platforms.
  \item \textbf{Schedule}: Weekly milestones will be set every Sunday, with dedicated work hours of 10â€“15 hours per week, including 2 hours for planning and reflection.
  \item \textbf{Decision-Making}: All decisions will be documented with rationale to ensure clarity and traceability.
  \item \textbf{Conflict Resolution}: As a solo project, conflicts are internal. Any challenges will be addressed by consulting course resources, instructor guidance, or external references (e.g., documentation, forums).
\end{itemize}

\section{Concept of Operations (CONOPS)}
% Outlining the purpose, scope, and features of the proposed solution
\subsection{Purpose}
Ayvu is a website that aims to simplify the process of accessing, reading, and understanding academic papers from arXiv (at least for the MVP). By integrating PDF parsing, cloud storage, and AI-driven features, the platform will provide an intuitive interface for researchers, students, and professionals to engage with complex research content efficiently.

\subsection{Product Scope}
The software addresses the challenge of navigating dense academic papers by offering a streamlined platform to fetch, parse, store, and interact with research papers. The target audience includes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Researchers and Academics}: Seeking efficient ways to read and annotate papers.
  \item \textbf{Students}: Learning to engage with technical literature.
  \item \textbf{Professionals}: Exploring research in their fields.
\end{itemize}
The platform is relevant in an era where open-access repositories like arXiv are widely used, but the complexity of research papers can be a barrier to comprehension. By leveraging AI and user-friendly design, the solution enhances accessibility and learning.

\subsection{Product Description}
The website will allow users to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input an arXiv link to fetch and parse a research paper into a readable markdown format.
  \item Store papers and annotations in a dedicated Google Drive folder.
  \item Interact with content via AI-driven features, such as highlighting key sections, asking questions, and learning unfamiliar concepts.
  \item Access a clean, responsive interface for reading and note-taking.
\end{itemize}
Key features include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Paper Parsing}: Convert PDFs to markdown using algorithmic approaches or LaTeX source.
  \item \textbf{Cloud Storage}: Seamless integration with Google Drive for storing papers and notes.
  \item \textbf{AI Assistance}: LLM-powered tools for summarizing, explaining concepts, and answering queries.
  \item \textbf{User Interface}: A modern, responsive front-end for intuitive navigation.
\end{itemize}

\section{Domain Model}
% Describing entities and relationships in the problem domain
The domain model captures the core entities and their relationships within the research paper reading ecosystem:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{User}: Represents an individual using the platform, identified by their Google account. Users can upload arXiv links, read parsed papers, and interact with AI features.
  \item \textbf{Research Paper}: A document fetched from arXiv, containing metadata (e.g., title, authors, abstract) and content (PDF or LaTeX). It is parsed into markdown for display.
  \item \textbf{Google Drive Folder}: A dedicated storage space for each user, containing raw PDFs, parsed markdown files, and user notes.
  \item \textbf{Note}: Annotations or comments created by the user, linked to a specific paper or section.
  \item \textbf{AI Assistant}: An LLM-based component that processes user queries, highlights key sections, and explains concepts.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Relationships}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{User} has one \textbf{Google Drive Folder}.
  \item A \textbf{Google Drive Folder} contains multiple \textbf{Research Papers} and \textbf{Notes}.
  \item A \textbf{Research Paper} is associated with multiple \textbf{Notes} and interacts with the \textbf{AI Assistant}.
  \item The \textbf{AI Assistant} processes \textbf{Research Papers} and \textbf{User} queries.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rationale}: The domain model focuses on the user's interaction with research papers, emphasizing storage and AI-driven comprehension. It simplifies the complexity of academic content by breaking it into manageable entities (papers, notes) and leveraging external services (Google Drive, AI) for scalability. This is visualized in figure \ref{fig:domainModel}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{EntityRelationshipDiagram.png}
  \caption{Domain Model}
  \label{fig:domainModel}
\end{figure}

\section{Toolset Selection}
% Specifying tools and their rationale
The following tools are selected for development, testing, and deployment:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Deno (Backend Runtime)}: A secure, lightweight runtime for TypeScript, suitable for edge environments due to its minimal dependencies and built-in TypeScript support.
  \item \textbf{Visual Studio Code (IDE)}: A versatile IDE with extensions for TypeScript, Svelte, and Git integration, supporting efficient development and debugging.
  \item \textbf{Vitest (Test Framework)}: A fast, Deno-compatible testing framework for unit and integration tests, ensuring robust backend and front-end testing.
  \item \textbf{Git/GitHub (Source Control)}: Git for version control, with GitHub as the repository for code management and CI/CD integration.
  \item \textbf{Vercel (Hosting)}: A free hosting platform optimized for SvelteKit, offering easy deployment and scalability.
  \item \textbf{Google Drive API}: Facilitates storage and retrieval of papers and notes, leveraging users' existing Google accounts.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rationale}: Deno is chosen for its edge compatibility and TypeScript support, aligning with the backend's requirements. VS Code provides a unified development environment. Vitest ensures efficient testing, while Git/GitHub supports version control and collaboration. Vercel is selected for its seamless SvelteKit integration, and Google Drive API offers reliable, user-owned storage.

\section{Programming Languages}
% Listing programming languages and their rationale
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{TypeScript}: Used for backend development with Deno and front-end logic in SvelteKit. Its static typing enhances code reliability and maintainability.
  \item \textbf{Svelte (SvelteKit)}: A JavaScript framework for building the reactive front-end, chosen for its simplicity and performance.
  \item \textbf{SCSS}: For styling the front-end, offering modular and maintainable CSS with variables and nesting.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Rationale}: TypeScript ensures type safety across the stack, reducing errors. SvelteKit provides a modern framework for fast, component-based UI development. SCSS enhances styling flexibility while keeping the codebase organized.

\section*{Participation}

\textbf{Standard of Work}:I will validate that the work is completed to a high-quality standard by committing to a minimum code coverage threshold of at least 90\% for unit tests, with a target code coverage threshold of 100\%. All major functional requirements, such as PDF parsing, Google Drive integration, AI-assisted features, and the SvelteKit frontend, will be validated with integration or end-to-end tests.
The application will also be accessibility tested using tools like Lighthouse or Wave to verify that there are no automated accessibility issues. Keyboard navigation and responsive design testing will be performed. All deliverables and project artifacts, such as the CONOPS, domain model, architecture diagrams, and documentation, will be completed in accordance with the necessary quality levels. \\

\textbf{Strategies to Achieve Standard of Work}: I will leverage my knowledge from previous courses and any relevant work experience to achieve high-quality outcomes consistent with the standard of work described above. This includes following an agile-like approach incorporating SCRUM, Kanban, and DevOps best practices for development, such as continuous integration with GitHub Actions and deployment to Vercel. \\

\textbf{Role Definition}: I will assume all responsibilities conventionally performed by a development team as part of the development process. I will formulate requirements, design the backend parsing logic, integrate storage and AI components, develop the frontend UI, test all parts, and perform project management functions. \\

\textbf{Deadlines}: I will submit all deliverables by the applicable deadlines; when possible, I will aim to submit deliverables in advance of the deadlines.

\section{Completion of work}

To complete work with a high quality and on time, work must be organized and structured.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Every Monday, I will perform backlog refinement. I will select the work for the week, create new tickets for tasks like backend parsing implementation or AI feature integration, update existing tickets as needed, and review the goals I have set.
  \item Every Monday, I will start a document for the assignment of the week to add to over the course of the week, including updates on domain model evolution or toolset adjustments.
  \item I will use a Kanban board with epics to organize tasks. Coding tasks (e.g., Deno backend development, SvelteKit UI components) and writing tasks (e.g., progress reports) alike will be listed here.
  \item I will create tickets to formalize the design before I start implementing its software, such as detailing the PDF parsing algorithm or Google Drive API flows.
  \item Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I will review the board, create new tickets, identify areas in which I lack knowledge (e.g., mupdf.js usage or LLM integration) and need to learn about, and reprioritize the selected work for the week.
  \item Every Saturday, I will put technical work aside and focus on the written assignment for the week if I feel that not enough progress has been made on it in comparison to the technical tasks.
  \item I will use git branches to prototype new features, such as testing LaTeX-to-Markdown conversion. For each new feature, I will create unit tests with Vitest and GitHub Actions and require that they all pass before the new feature can be merged.
  \item I will maintain documentation. Comments in the code, usage instructions for the website, and rationale for choices like edge environment compatibility are important.
\end{itemize}

\section{Roadblock Mitigation}
Spending too much time on something that I am blocked on is counter productive. It is important to identify such tasks early. Backlog refinements is a good time to review this. I must balance working on easier tasks first and making sure that I do not run out of time to work on the blocked item.

Some possible ways I could resolve a roadblock is dedicating time to do research and training (e.g., on algorithmic PDF parsing techniques or Google Drive API permissions), identifying technical tasks that must be completed before the roadblock can be cleared (e.g., setting up Deno environment before parsing logic), and reaching out for help from the professor or experts online (e.g., forums for SvelteKit or AI integration issues).

\section{Team Consequences}
Not applicable, as this is a solo project.

\section{Personal Accountability Statements}
I will observe the PSU Code of Conduct and PSU Academic Integrity. I will complete this project to the best of my ability and in accordance with proper academic standards.

\section{Sprint Backlog}
\label{sec:sprint-backlog}

The Sprint Backlog for Ayvu is presented below. This backlog is a prioritized subset of the Product Backlog (Table \ref{tab:product-backlog}), focusing on foundational requirements critical to building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) during the two-week sprint. The selected User Stories emphasize user authentication, Google Drive integration, and core paper fetching and parsing functionalities, as these are essential for enabling the basic workflow of the application. The prioritization considers dependencies (e.g., authentication and storage setup must precede paper fetching) and the criticality of features for the MVP, with effort estimations based on the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13). The Sprint Backlog is managed in a project management tool (e.g., GitLab), ensuring alignment with the agile development process.

The sprint backlog is built on Github Projects, which is linked to the GitHub repository for the project. The board has columns for Backlog, To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done. Each user story is represented as a card on the board, with tasks broken down into smaller sub-tasks as needed. The board is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the current status of each task. You can view the project board here: \url{https://github.com/users/ABSanthosh/projects/20/views/1}

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Prioritization and Estimation Rationale}
The Sprint Backlog includes User Stories US-1, US-2, US-3, US-5, US-6, and US-8, selected for their foundational role in enabling Ayvu's core functionality. US-1 (Sign in with Google) and US-2 (Grant Drive Permissions) are prerequisites for US-3 (Create Drive Folder), ensuring users can authenticate and set up storage. US-5 (Fetch Paper Metadata) and US-6 (Download Paper PDF) are critical for retrieving papers from arXiv, while US-8 (Store Files in Drive) ensures proper storage in Google Drive. These stories were prioritized as ``High'' due to their necessity for the MVP and their dependencies, as subsequent features (e.g., parsing and viewing) rely on them. Effort estimations use the Fibonacci sequence, with most stories assigned 3 points due to moderate complexity involving API integrations (Google OAuth, arXiv API, Google Drive API), and US-3 assigned 2 points for its simpler folder creation task. The total estimated effort is 17 story points, feasible for a three-week sprint by a solo developer. Other stories, such as US-7 (Parse PDF to Markdown) and US-9 (View Markdown Content), were deferred to the next sprint due to their dependency on these foundational features and higher complexity (e.g., US-7 estimated at 8 points).

\section{Architecture Representation}

The architecture for Ayvu, a web application designed to streamline the process of accessing, parsing, storing, and interacting with academic research papers from arXiv, is outlined below. This design reflects a high-level, edge-friendly architecture tailored to the project's goals of simplicity, scalability, and user privacy, leveraging the specified technologies (Deno, TypeScript, SvelteKit, mupdf.js, and APIs for arXiv and Google Drive). The architecture adopts a \textbf{Client-Server with Edge Computing} style, integrating a lightweight backend for serverless execution and a responsive frontend, with external services handling storage and data retrieval.

\subsection{Architectural Diagram Description}
The architecture comprises three main components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Frontend (SvelteKit Application)}: Represents the user interface, built with SvelteKit for reactive, responsive web experiences. It includes a form for arXiv URL input, a markdown viewer, note-taking tools, and an AI query sidebar. Hosted on Vercel for free CI/CD deployment, ensuring scalability and edge compatibility.
  \item \textbf{Backend (Deno Edge Functions)}: A serverless backend built with Deno and TypeScript, deployed to an edge environment (e.g., Cloudflare Workers or Vercel Functions). It handles API requests to arXiv and Google Drive, parses PDFs using mupdf.js, and orchestrates data flow. Designed for low latency and scalability, avoiding heavy dependencies by leveraging edge computing.
  \item \textbf{External Services}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{arXiv API}: Fetches paper metadata and PDFs, integrated via HTTP requests from the backend.
      \item \textbf{Google Drive API}: Manages storage of raw PDFs, parsed markdown, and user notes in the user's Drive folder, accessed with OAuth permissions.
      \item \textbf{AI Service}: An external LLM API (e.g., Grok or an open-source model) provides AI-assisted features like explanations and highlights, called via the backend or frontend.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
These components communicate as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The Frontend sends user inputs (e.g., arXiv URLs) to the Backend via RESTful API calls.
  \item The Backend interacts with the arXiv API to fetch data, processes it with mupdf.js for parsing, and uses the Google Drive API to store files.
  \item The AI Service is queried by the Backend or Frontend to generate responses, which are returned to the user interface.

\section{Sprint Planning for Sprint 1}
% Describing the sprint planning process, prioritization, effort estimation, and Definition of Done for user stories

\subsection{Sprint Planning Process}
The Sprint Planning for Sprint 1, conducted in Week 3, focuses on initiating the development of the Ayvu web application by prioritizing foundational User Stories critical to the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The Sprint Backlog comprises User Stories US-1, US-2, US-3, US-5, US-6, and US-8, selected based on their role in enabling core functionalities: user authentication, Google Drive integration, and arXiv paper retrieval. These stories were chosen to establish the groundwork for subsequent features like PDF parsing and AI-assisted interactions, which depend on these components.

The prioritization process followed a stakeholder-driven approach, emphasizing features essential for user onboarding and data retrieval, as outlined in the project's Concept of Operations (CONOPS). US-1 (Sign in with Google) and US-2 (Grant Drive Permissions) are prerequisites for US-3 (Create Drive Folder), ensuring users can authenticate and set up storage. US-5 (Fetch Paper Metadata) and US-6 (Download Paper PDF) enable arXiv integration, while US-8 (Store Files in Drive) ensures data persistence. These stories were assigned high priority due to their dependencies and critical role in the MVP.

Effort estimations were performed using the Fibonacci sequence, as documented in the Sprint Backlog (see Section~\ref{sec:sprint-backlog}). Each User Story was evaluated based on complexity, considering factors like API integration (Google OAuth, arXiv API, Google Drive API) and setup requirements. Most stories were estimated at 3 story points, reflecting moderate complexity, while US-3 was assigned 2 points due to its simpler folder creation task. The total effort of 17 story points is feasible for a three-week sprint by a solo developer, accounting for 10â€“15 hours of weekly work.

The Agile board, hosted on Github Projects, has been updated to reflect the Sprint Backlog. The board is integrated with the GitHub repository to map commits to User Stories. This integration supports traceability and aligns with the project's DevOps practices.

\subsection{Definition of Done (DoD) for Sprint Backlog User Stories}
The Definition of Done (DoD) ensures that each User Story is fully implemented, tested, and integrated, meeting the project's quality standards (e.g., 90â€“100\% unit test coverage, accessibility compliance).

\section{Backlog Grooming for Sprint 1}
No changes this week as foundational setup is on track.

\section{Source Code Development for Sprint 1}
% Reporting progress on source code development for the Ayvu project

\subsection{Progress Overview}
In Week 3, the focus has been on spike stories to establish a functional development environment for the Ayvu web application. The initial setup of the SvelteKit project was completed using the `npx sv create ayvu` framework, with dependencies installed to support the frontend development. Research into integrating Google OAuth, arXiv API, and Google Drive API has begun, with preliminary configurations explored to ensure compatibility with the Deno backend. Approximately 100\% of the setup tasks are complete, including project initialization and environment configuration, with ongoing work to refine API integration scripts.

\subsection{Repository Details}
The source code is hosted at \href{https://github.com/ABSanthosh/ayvu}{https://github.com/ABSanthosh/ayvu}, integrated with the Agile board on GitHub Projects for tracking progress. The repository contains the initial SvelteKit structure with basic scaffolding for integrating a database using Turso and OAuth using Googleapis library.

\subsection{Burndown Chart}

\subsection{Description}
The burndown chart tracks the progress of Sprint 1, which has a total of 17 story points across the Sprint Backlog User Stories. The sprint spans three weeks (15 working days), with an ideal burn rate of approximately 5.67 points per week. As of the end of Week 3 (September 14, 2025, first week of Sprint 1), 11 points are marked as "Done," 5 points remain in "To Do,". This is due to the spike work like environment setup and API research. The ideal remaining at the end of Week 1 is approximately 11.35 points, while the actual remaining is 5 points, indicating the sprint is ahead of schedule.

The Agile board (\href{https://github.com/users/ABSanthosh/projects/20/views/1}{GitHub Projects}) reflects this state, with tasks aligned to User Stories (US-1, US-2, US-3, US-5, US-6, US-8).

  \caption{Burndown Chart as of End of Week 3 (Week 1 of Sprint 1). Actual progress will update weekly based on completed tasks.}
  \label{fig:burndown}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Rationale and Projections}
The current burn of 11 points by the end of Week 1 exceeds the ideal burn of 5.67 points, reflecting efficient completion of spike tasks (e.g., SvelteKit setup, initial API configurations). The remaining 5 points are projected to be completed by mid-Week 2 (Sprint Day 8), with the sprint potentially finishing early if no blockers arise. The 39 points in the Product Backlog will be considered for future sprints. The chart will be updated weekly on the GitHub Projects board and in subsequent reports to reflect ongoing progress.

\subsection{Testing Framework and Automation Strategy}
All unit tests are implemented using Vitest, chosen for its compatibility with Deno and TypeScript. The testing framework includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Mock Services}: Comprehensive mocking of external APIs (Google OAuth, Drive API, arXiv API) to ensure reliable, repeatable testing
  \item \textbf{Test Data Management}: Structured test data sets for various scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions
  \item \textbf{Coverage Reporting}: Automated coverage reporting integrated with the CI/CD pipeline, targeting 90-100\% code coverage
  \item \textbf{Continuous Integration}: GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs all tests on commits and pull requests
\end{itemize}

The expanded test suite provides comprehensive coverage of all Sprint 1 functionalities, ensuring robust validation of both individual components and their integration, supporting the project's commitment to high-quality, reliable software delivery.
